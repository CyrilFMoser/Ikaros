- ! Store the instantiated type arguments of the Base with the Variant, don't create new bases for new instantiations of the base. !
    Therefore only add new bases for declarations and if they somehow appear in a parameter of a variant

- Merge generics

- Allow variants to instantiate some of the bases type arguments, (for scala)

- Maybe add structs to the IR?
