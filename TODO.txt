- Change is_subtype() so that it returns a result, Err if there is no way it could be a subtype,
  Ok(Constraint) with constraint being equality constraints on the types for it to be a subtype. (Sets of (t1,t2) => t1 <: t2)
  The constraints will be solved by the type graph, so they don't have to make sense.
  => Need to modify it even further. Create a Constraint struct, that captures:
    1. Equality constraints with a field for a HashSet<(Type,Type)>
    2. Subtype constraints with a field for a HashSet<(Type,Type)>
    Then it would probably be worth it to return Result<Option<THAT_STRUCT>,()>

- Merge generics

- Allow variance declarations for case classes
